## About CWE ID 918

_<mark style="color:green;">**Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**</mark>_

This vulnerability occurs when an attacker can manipulate or influence the requests being made by a server to other internal or external resources, typically on behalf of the server itself.

## Impact

* Data Exposure
* Information Leakage
* Network Scanning
* Service Disruption
* Proxying Attacks
* Security Bypass
* Remote Code Execution

## Example with Code Explanation

Let us consider an example case and understand the CWE 918 with context of Vulnerable code and Mitigated code.

## `Python`

### Vulnerable Code

```python
import requests

def fetch_url(url):
    response = requests.get(url)
    return response.text

# This function takes a URL as input from an untrusted source
# and fetches the content from that URL without proper validation.

user_input = input("Enter a URL to fetch: ")
content = fetch_url(user_input)
print("Content from the URL:")
print(content)
```

In the above example, the code defines a **`fetch_url`** function that takes a URL as input and uses the **`requests`** library to make an HTTP GET request to that URL. The user is prompted to enter a URL, and the code fetches and displays the content from that URL.

This code is vulnerable to SSRF because it does not properly `validate or sanitize` the user input. An attacker could provide a malicious URL that targets internal resources or external systems. For example, an attacker could enter a URL like **`http://internal-server/private-data`** to access sensitive internal resources that should not be publicly accessible.

* Some of the ways the Vulnerable code can be mitigated is:
  * **Input Validation**:
    * **URL Whitelisting**: Maintain a whitelist of allowed domains or resources that the application can access. Validate that user-supplied URLs match the whitelist.
    * **URL Validation**: Use a URL parsing library or regular expressions to validate user-supplied URLs. Ensure they follow the expected format.
    * **IP Address Validation**: If IP addresses are used, validate them to ensure they are safe and do not point to sensitive internal systems.
  * **Access Controls**:
    * **Least Privilege**: Restrict the permissions and access level of the server making the requests. Ensure it only has access to resources it needs and nothing more.
    * **Network Segmentation**: Isolate the server from sensitive internal networks and resources whenever possible to limit the impact of an SSRF attack.
  * **Content-Type Checks**:
    * Verify that the content-type of the response from the requested URL matches the expected type, e.g., if you expect an image, check that it's indeed an image.
  * **Request Sanitization**:
    * Sanitize user-supplied input before making requests. Remove any potentially harmful characters or sequences.
  * **Use Safe Libraries**:
    * If possible, use libraries or functions that have built-in protections against SSRF, or those that allow you to define a white list of allowed resources.
  * **Patch Management**:
    * Keep all libraries, frameworks, and software up to date to ensure that known SSRF vulnerabilities in third-party components are patched.

### Mitigated Code

```python
import requests
import validators
from urllib.parse import urlparse
import tldextract  # Install using: pip install tldextract
import ipaddress
import dns.resolver

# Define a whitelist of allowed domains or resources
ALLOWED_DOMAINS = ["example.com", "public-api.com"]

def is_valid_url(url):
    # Validate the URL format using a third-party library
    return validators.url(url)

def is_domain_allowed(url):
    # Extract the top-level domain (TLD) using tldextract
    extracted = tldextract.extract(url)
    domain = extracted.domain
    tld = extracted.suffix

    # Check if the domain and TLD are in the whitelist
    return f"{domain}.{tld}" in ALLOWED_DOMAINS

def is_ip_allowed(url):
    # Resolve the domain to an IP address using a DNS resolver library
    parsed_url = urlparse(url)
    domain = parsed_url.netloc
    answer = dns.resolver.resolve(domain, "A")
    ip = answer[0].to_text()

    # Check if the IP address is private or reserved
    return not ipaddress.ip_address(ip).is_private and not ipaddress.ip_address(ip).is_reserved

def is_scheme_allowed(url):
    # Get a list of valid schemes from the validators module
    valid_schemes = validators.url.schemes

    # Parse the URL using a built-in library
    parsed_url = urlparse(url)

    # Check if the scheme is in the valid schemes list
    return parsed_url.scheme in valid_schemes

def fetch_url(url):
    if not is_valid_url(url):
        raise ValueError("Invalid URL format")

    if not is_domain_allowed(url):
        raise ValueError("Access to this domain is not allowed")

    if not is_ip_allowed(url):
        raise ValueError("Access to this IP address is not allowed")

    if not is_scheme_allowed(url):
        raise ValueError("Unsupported scheme")

    # Verify the SSL certificates if using https
    verify = True if urlparse(url).scheme == "https" else False

    response = requests.get(url, timeout=5, verify=verify)  # Set a timeout and verify SSL certificates
    if response.status_code != 200:
        raise Exception("Failed to fetch URL")

    return response.text

try:
    user_input = input("Enter a URL to fetch: ")
    content = fetch_url(user_input)
    print("Content from the URL:")
    print(content)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {str(e)}")
```

* The Mitigated code does the following:
  * **URL Validation (`is_valid_url`):** The code uses the **`validators.url`** function to validate the URL format. This helps prevent basic URL manipulation attacks by ensuring that the input adheres to a valid URL format.
  * **Domain Whitelisting (`is_domain_allowed`):** It extracts the top-level domain (TLD) using **`tldextract`** and checks if the combination of the domain and TLD is in the **`ALLOWED_DOMAINS`** whitelist. This whitelist approach helps prevent access to unauthorized domains, which is a key defense against SSRF attacks.
  * **IP Address Validation (`is_ip_allowed`):** The code also resolves the domain to an IP address using a DNS resolver (**`dns.resolver`**) and checks whether the resulting IP address is private or reserved using the **`ipaddress`** module. This is a crucial security measure to prevent SSRF via IP address, ensuring that only public and non-reserved IP addresses are allowed.
  * **Scheme Validation (`is_scheme_allowed`):** It checks if the URL scheme is one of the valid schemes defined by the **`validators`** module. This prevents unsupported schemes from being used, reducing the attack surface.
  * **SSL Certificate Verification (`requests.get`):** The code verifies SSL certificates when making an HTTPS request, which is a good practice to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

## `JAVA`

### Vulnerable Code

```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.net.URL;
import java.net.URLConnection;

public class VulnerableSSRFExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
            System.out.print("Enter a URL to fetch: ");
            String userInput = reader.readLine();
            
            // No validation or sanitization is performed on the user input.
            // An attacker can input a malicious URL.
            URL url = new URL(userInput);
            URLConnection connection = url.openConnection();
            
            BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(connection.getInputStream()));
            String inputLine;
            while ((inputLine = in.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println(inputLine);
            }
            in.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

The Vulnerable code does the following:

1. The program takes `user input as a URL` without any `validation or sanitization`.
2. It directly creates a **`URL`** object and establishes a connection to the provided URL.
3. The content from the URL is then read and printed to the console.

This code is susceptible to CWE-918 because it doesn't `perform any validation or whitelisting of the input URL`. An attacker can easily manipulate the URL to access internal resources or potentially launch SSRF attacks by pointing the URL to sensitive internal services.

* Some of the ways the Vulnerable code can be mitigated is:
  * **URL Validation:**
    * Always validate user-provided URLs using a URL validation library or regular expressions to ensure they conform to expected URL formats (e.g., **`https://example.com`**, not **`file:///etc/passwd`**).
    * Use the **`java.net.URL`** class to parse and validate URLs before making requests. This class provides basic URL validation.
  * **Domain Whitelisting:**
    * Maintain a `whitelist of allowed` domains or `IP addresse`s that the application is allowed to access. Compare the parsed URL's host against this whitelist.
    * Implement a domain extraction mechanism to validate the domain against the whitelist, considering variations like subdomains.
  * **IP Address Validation:**
    * If your application needs to work with IP addresses, validate them to ensure they are public and non-reserved IP addresses. You can use the **`InetAddress`** and **`CIDRUtils`** classes in Java to help with this validation.
    * Consider using a dedicated library or function to resolve DNS entries and verify that the resolved IP addresses are not private or reserved.
  * **URL Scheme Validation:**
    * Verify that the URL scheme is one of the expected and safe schemes (e.g., **`http`** or **`https`**) before making the request.
  * **Request Wrapper:**
    * Implement a request wrapper that restricts the types of URLs that can be accessed. The wrapper should enforce the above validation rules.
  * **Use Libraries and Frameworks:**
    * Consider using security libraries and frameworks designed to mitigate `SSRF` vulnerabilities, such as the `OWASP CSRFGuard` library.
  * **Least Privilege Principle:**
    * Ensure that the application's user or service account has the `least privilege` necessary to perform its tasks. Avoid running the application as a superuser or with excessive privileges.

import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.net.URI;
import java.net.URL;
import java.net.URLConnection;
import org.apache.commons.validator.routines.UrlValidator;

public class MitigatedSSRFExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
            System.out.print("Enter a URL to fetch: ");
            String userInput = reader.readLine();
            
            // Validate and sanitize the user input using UrlValidator
            String[] schemes = {"http", "https"}; // Specify the allowed schemes
            UrlValidator urlValidator = new UrlValidator(schemes); // Create a UrlValidator instance
            if (urlValidator.isValid(userInput)) { // Check if the user input is a valid URL
                URI uri = new URI(userInput); // Parse and normalize the URL using URI class
                String host = uri.getHost(); // Get the host name from the URI
                int port = uri.getPort(); // Get the port number from the URI
                String path = uri.getPath(); // Get the path from the URI
                
                // Enforce the URL destination with a positive allow list
                // For example, only allow requests to www.example.com on port 80 or 443
                if (host.equals("www.example.com") && (port == 80 || port == 443)) {
                    URL url = uri.toURL(); // Convert the URI to URL
                    URLConnection connection = url.openConnection();
                    connection.setInstanceFollowRedirects(false); // Disable HTTP redirections
                    
                    BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(connection.getInputStream()));
                    String inputLine;
                    while ((inputLine = in.readLine()) != null) {
                        System.out.println(inputLine);
                    }
                    in.close();
                } else {
                    System.out.println("URL destination is not allowed");
                }
            } else {
                System.out.println("Invalid URL");
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

* The Mitigated code does the following:
  * **URL Validation (`UrlValidator`):** The code uses the **`UrlValidator`** class from the Apache Commons Validator library to validate and sanitize the user input URL. This helps ensure that the input URL adheres to a valid format with allowed schemes (http or https).
  * **URI Parsing and Normalization:** After validating the URL using **`UrlValidator`**, the code parses and normalizes the URL using the **`URI`** class. This is a good practice to ensure that the URL is well-formed and to handle any encoding or special characters properly.
  * **Host and Port Verification:** The code extracts the host name and port number from the URI and checks if they match the allowed destination ([**www.example.com**](http://www.example.com/)) and ports (80 or 443). This enforces a positive allow list for the URL destination. If the host and port don't match the allowed values, the code rejects the request.
  * **HTTP Redirections Disabled:** The code sets **`setInstanceFollowRedirects(false)`** to disable HTTP redirections. This is important because SSRF attacks can sometimes be carried out by tricking the server into making requests to internal resources through redirections. By disabling redirections, the code prevents this type of abuse.

## `Ruby`

### Vulnerable Code

```ruby
require 'open-uri'

def fetch_url(url)
  content = open(url).read
  puts "Content from the URL:"
  puts content
rescue StandardError => e
  puts "Error: #{e.message}"
end

print "Enter a URL to fetch: "
user_input = gets.chomp

fetch_url(user_input)
```

The Vulnerable code does the following:

1. The program takes `user input as a URL` without any `validation or sanitization`.
2. It directly uses the **`open`** method to fetch the content of the URL.
3. The content from the URL is then read and printed to the console.

This code is susceptible to CWE-918 because it doesn't perform any validation or whitelisting of the input URL. An attacker can easily manipulate the URL to access internal resources or potentially launch SSRF attacks by pointing the URL to sensitive internal services.

* Some of the ways the Vulnerable code can be mitigated is:
  * **URL Validation:**
    * Use a URL validation library or regular expressions to ensure that user-provided URLs conform to expected URL formats (e.g., **`https://example.com`**, not **`file:///etc/passwd`**).
    * Check for the scheme of the URL (e.g., **`http`** or **`https`**) to ensure that it is a valid scheme.
  * **Domain Whitelisting:**
    * Maintain a whitelist of allowed domains or IP addresses that the application is allowed to access. Compare the parsed URL's host against this whitelist.
    * Implement a domain extraction mechanism to validate the domain against the whitelist, considering variations like subdomains.
  * **URL Parsing and Normalization:**
    * Use a URL parsing library to parse and normalize user-provided URLs. This helps ensure proper handling of special characters and encoding.
    * Extract the hostname and port from the URL to verify that it matches allowed values.
  * **HTTP Redirection Handling:**
    * Implement proper handling of HTTP redirections. By default, the code should follow redirections (e.g., using **`open-uri`**'s **`:redirects`** option). However, ensure that redirections do not lead to unexpected or unauthorized destinations.
  * **URI Manipulation Protection:**
    * Protect against URL manipulation by verifying that the path, query parameters, and other components of the URL do not contain dangerous input or payloads.
  * **Logging and Monitoring:**
    * Implement logging to track user input and requests, especially when accessing external resources.
    * Set up monitoring to detect suspicious activity, such as unusual patterns of URL requests.
  * **Input Sanitization:**
    * Sanitize user input to remove or escape potentially dangerous characters. For example, use functions like **`CGI.escape`** to sanitize query parameters.

### Mitigated Code

```ruby
require 'uri'
require 'net/http'
require 'open-uri'

# Define a whitelist of allowed domains or resources
ALLOWED_DOMAINS = ['example.com', 'public-api.com']
# Define a whitelist of allowed ports
ALLOWED_PORTS = [80, 443]
# Define a whitelist of allowed schemes
ALLOWED_SCHEMES = ['http', 'https']

def is_valid_url?(url)
  uri = URI.parse(url)
  # Normalize the URL to avoid tricks like IP addresses, subdomains, or encoded characters
  uri = uri.normalize
  # Check if the scheme is in the whitelist
  return false unless ALLOWED_SCHEMES.include?(uri.scheme)
  # Check if the host (domain) is in the whitelist
  return false unless ALLOWED_DOMAINS.include?(uri.host)
  # Check if the port is in the whitelist
  return false unless ALLOWED_PORTS.include?(uri.port)
  # Return true if all checks passed
  true
end

def fetch_url(url)
  if is_valid_url?(url)
    begin
      # Disable HTTP redirections
      open(url, allow_redirections: :safe) do |response|
        content = response.read
        puts 'Content from the URL:'
        puts content
      end
    rescue OpenURI::HTTPError => e
      puts "HTTP Error: #{e.message}"
    rescue StandardError => e
      puts "Error: #{e.message}"
    end
  else
    puts 'Invalid URL format or access not allowed.'
  end
end

print 'Enter a URL to fetch: '
user_input = gets.chomp

fetch_url(user_input)
```

* The Mitigated does the following:
  * **URL Validation (`is_valid_url?` function):**
    * The code validates the URL format by parsing it using **`URI.parse(url)`** and then normalizing it using **`uri.normalize`**. This normalization helps prevent tricks like using IP addresses, subdomains, or encoded characters to bypass the whitelist.
    * It checks if the URL scheme is in the **`ALLOWED_SCHEMES`** whitelist, ensuring that only 'http' and 'https' schemes are allowed.
    * It verifies if the host (domain) is in the **`ALLOWED_DOMAINS`** whitelist, restricting access to specific domains.
    * It checks if the port is in the **`ALLOWED_PORTS`** whitelist, limiting access to specific ports.
    * If any of these checks fail, the function returns **`false`**, and the URL is considered invalid.
  * **HTTP Redirection Handling:**
    * The code uses the **`open-uri`** library with the **`allow_redirections: :safe`** option to disable HTTP redirections. This prevents SSRF attacks through redirections, as the code only fetches the content from the initially provided URL.
  * **Error Handling:**
    * The code includes error handling for HTTP errors (e.g., 404 Not Found) and general exceptions, which ensures that it gracefully handles unexpected issues without exposing sensitive information.
  * **Whitelists:**
    * The code uses `whitelists for allowed domains`, `ports`, and `schemes`. This is an effective security measure to restrict requests to trusted resources and prevent unauthorized access.

## Mitigation

* Some common mitigation techniques include:
  * **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    * `Validate and sanitize` all user-provided input, especially URLs, before using them in any HTTP request. Ensure that the input adheres to a safe format.
  * **URL Whitelisting:**
    * Maintain a `whitelist of allowed domains`, `IP addresses`, and `ports` that your application is allowed to access. Only permit requests to resources on this whitelist.
  * **URL Normalization:**
    * `Normalize` URLs to a consistent format to prevent attackers from using various tricks like IP addresses, subdomains, or encoded characters to bypass restrictions.
  * **Scheme Validation:**
    * Ensure that the URL scheme is limited to safe schemes like `http` and `https.` Reject URLs with unsupported or dangerous schemes.
  * **Restrict External Access:**
    * Design your network architecture to `limit external access` to only the necessary resources. Employ firewalls and network-level access controls.
  * **HTTP Redirect Controls:**
    * `Disable or carefully control HTTP redirections` to prevent attackers from tricking the application into making requests to internal or unauthorized resources.
  * **DNS Resolution Safeguards:**
    * When resolving domain names to IP addresses, ensure that the IP addresses are `public and not reserved`. Implement DNS resolution controls to prevent access to internal resources via DNS.
  * **Use Safe Libraries and Frameworks:**
    * Utilize `security-focused libraries and frameworks` that have built-in protections against SSRF and other common web security issues.
  * **Least Privilege Principle:**
    * Ensure that the service or user account making the requests has `minimal privileges` required to perform its tasks. Avoid running with superuser or excessive permissions.
  * **Logging and Monitoring:**
    * Implement comprehensive logging to `track and monitor` all outbound requests, especially those involving user input. Set up alerting systems to detect and respond to suspicious activities.
  * **Regular Security Audits and Testing:**
    * Conduct regular `security audits, penetration testing, and code reviews` to identify and address SSRF vulnerabilities and other security issues.
  * **Dependency Updates:**
    * `Keep all libraries, frameworks, and software components` up to date with security patches to reduce the risk of known vulnerabilities.
