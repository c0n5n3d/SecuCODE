## About CWE 798

_<mark style="color:green;">**Use of Hard-coded Credentials**</mark>_

This Vulnerability occurs when software systems that involve the use of credentials (such as usernames and passwords) that are `hard-coded` directly into the source code or configuration files of an application.

_**What is Inbound/Outbound Variant?**_

* **Inbound** use of hard-coded credentials involves using hard-coded credentials to authenticate incoming requests or connections to the application.
  * _**For example**_, let's say you have a web application that requires users to enter a username and password to log in. In this scenario, if the application's source code contains hard-coded credentials that are used to authenticate the incoming user requests, it would be an example of inbound use of hard-coded credentials.
* **Outbound** use of hard-coded credentials involves using hard-coded credentials to authenticate the application itself when it interacts with external systems or services.
  * _**For Example,**_ consider a software application that needs to connect to a database for retrieving or storing data. If the application's code contains hard-coded credentials that are used to authenticate the application when establishing the connection to the database, it would be an example of outbound use of hard-coded credentials.

## Impact

* Unauthorized Access
* Credential Exposure
* Lack of Accountability
* Difficulty in Credential Management
* Compliance Violations

## Example with Code Explanation:

* Let us consider an example case and understand the CWE 798 with context of Vulnerable code and Mitigated code.

## `C`

### Vulnerable Code

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void authenticate(char* username, char* password) {
    char validUsername[] = "admin";
    char validPassword[] = "password123";

    if (strcmp(username, validUsername) == 0 && strcmp(password, validPassword) == 0) {
        printf("Authentication successful.\n");
    } else {
        printf("Authentication failed.\n");
    }
}

int main() {
    char username[] = "admin";
    char password[] = "password123";

    authenticate(username, password);

    return 0;
}
```

In this code, the **`authenticate`** function compares the provided **`username`** and **`password`** with hard-coded credentials (**`validUsername`** and **`validPassword`**). If the comparison succeeds, it prints `Authentication successful`, indicating a successful login. Otherwise, it prints `Authentication failed.` This approach is vulnerable because the valid credentials are `hard-coded` directly into the source code. If an attacker gains access to the code, they can easily extract the credentials and potentially gain unauthorized access to the system.

Some of the ways the Vulnerable code can be mitigated is:

* `Use Credential Storage Mechanisms:`Instead of hard-coding credentials directly in the code or configuration files, use secure storage mechanisms such as encrypted files, secure key stores, or dedicated credential management systems. This helps protect the credentials from unauthorized access and reduces the risk of exposure.
* `Externalize Credentials:`Store credentials separately from the application code. Use external configuration files or environment variables to provide credentials at runtime. This separation allows for easier credential management, reduces the risk of accidental exposure, and facilitates secure deployment and configuration management.
* `Employ Encryption or Hashing:`If credentials need to be stored within the application, consider using strong encryption or hashing algorithms to protect them. This adds an additional layer of security and makes it harder for attackers to extract the original credentials even if they gain access to the code.
* `Implement Credential Rotation:`Regularly rotate credentials, especially for sensitive accounts or high-value systems. Periodic rotation of credentials reduces the window of opportunity for attackers and limits the potential impact of a compromised credential.
* `Use Token-based Authentication:`Instead of using traditional username/password combinations, consider implementing token-based authentication mechanisms such as JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or OAuth. These mechanisms eliminate the need for hard-coded credentials and provide more secure and flexible authentication options.
* `Employ Secure Key Management:`If using API keys, access tokens, or other forms of credentials, employ secure key management practices. This includes securely generating, distributing, and revoking keys, as well as implementing appropriate access controls and auditing mechanisms.

   memset(password, 0, sizeof(password));

   return 0;
}
```

The Mitigated code does the following:

* `Retrieval of credentials:` The mitigated code simulates retrieving credentials from a `secure configuration file or external source`. It uses SSL/TLS to establish a secure connection, loads a trust store, verifies the server certificate, and reads the encrypted credentials from the configuration file. The actual retrieval logic may vary depending on the implementation.
* `Encryption and decryption:` The mitigated code includes encryption and decryption mechanisms to protect the credentials stored in the configuration file. It assumes a symmetric key for decryption, although the actual implementation may use a more secure encryption scheme.
* `Hashing and constant-time comparison:` The mitigated code hashes the input password using a cryptographic hash function (SHA-256) and a salt value. It then compares the hashed password and username with the retrieved values using a constant-time comparison function. This prevents attackers from exploiting timing attacks to gain information about the credentials.
* `Secure memory handling:` The mitigated code clears the credentials from memory using **`memset`** after authentication to minimize the risk of the sensitive data being accessed by other processes or attackers.

## `Java`

### Vulnerable Code

* The below Vulnerable and Mitgated code focuses on Inbound Authentication.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class VulnerableCode {

    // Simulating hard-coded default credentials for first time logins
    private static final String DEFAULT_USERNAME = "admin";
    private static final String DEFAULT_PASSWORD = "password123";

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Assume credentials are obtained securely at runtime
        // For demonstration purposes, use hard-coded values
        String username = "admin";
        String password = "password123";

        authenticate(username, password);

        // Clear credentials from memory
        username = null;
        password = null;

        scanner.close();
    }

    public static void authenticate(String username, String password) {
        // Perform authentication logic
        // For demonstration purposes, compare with default credentials
        if (username.equals(DEFAULT_USERNAME) && password.equals(DEFAULT_PASSWORD)) {
            System.out.println("Authentication successful.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Authentication failed.");
        }
    }
}
```

The code is Vulnerable, because it uses hard-coded default credentials for first time logins. The default username and password are stored in plain text in the **`DEFAULT_USERNAME`** and **`DEFAULT_PASSWORD`** constants and can be easily extracted by an attacker. This can allow an attacker to bypass the authentication mechanism and access the system.

* Some of the ways the Vulnerable code can be mitigated is
* For Inbound Authentication, `Implement a "first login" mode:` Instead of hard-coding default credentials, introduce a mechanism where users are required to enter a unique strong password or key during their initial login. This ensures that each user sets their own credentials. (as per CWE listed Potential Mitigations).
* `Use secure storage for credentials:` Store the user's credentials in a secure manner, such as using cryptographic techniques to protect sensitive information. Avoid storing plaintext passwords or keys.
* `Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA):` Consider implementing MFA, where users are required to provide additional verification factors (such as a one-time password or biometric data) along with their credentials. This adds an extra layer of security to the authentication process.

### Mitigated Code

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class MitigatedCode {

    // Simulating a "first login" mode that requires the user to enter a unique strong password
    private static boolean firstLogin = true; // A flag to indicate whether it is the first login or not
    private static String username; // A variable to store the user's username
    private static String password; // A variable to store the user's password

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        if (firstLogin) {
            System.out.println("Welcome to the system. Please enter a unique username and a strong password.");
            username = scanner.nextLine(); // Assume input validation and error handling
            password = scanner.nextLine(); // Assume input validation and error handling
            System.out.println("Thank you. Your credentials are saved.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Please enter your username and password.");
            username = scanner.nextLine(); // Assume input validation and error handling
            password = scanner.nextLine(); // Assume input validation and error handling
        }

        authenticate(username, password);

        // Clear credentials from memory
        username = null;
        password = null;

        scanner.close();
    }

    public static void authenticate(String username, String password) {
        // Perform authentication logic
        // For demonstration purposes, compare with stored credentials
        if (username.equals(username) && password.equals(password)) {
            System.out.println("Authentication successful.");
            if (firstLogin) {
                System.out.println("Please change your password to a strong one.");
                firstLogin = false; // Reset the flag after the first login
            }
        } else {
            System.out.println("Authentication failed.");
        }
    }
}
```

The Mitigated code does the following:

* The code demonstrates mitigation for CWE-798 by implementing a `first login` mode that requires the user to enter a unique strong password, for inbound Authentication.

## `Python`

### Vulnerable Code

```python
import requests

# Hard-coded credentials
username = "admin"
password = "secret"

# Outbound communication to an external component
response = requests.get("https://example.com/api", auth=(username, password))

# Inbound authentication using passwords
def login(user, pwd):
    # Check the input credentials against a hard-coded set of credentials
    if user == username and pwd == password:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

The above code is Vulnerable due to:

`Hard-coded credentials:` The username and password are directly embedded in the code, making them easily accessible to anyone who has access to the source code.

`Outbound communication:` The code sends the username and password as part of the HTTP request to the external API using the **`requests.get()`** function. This means that the credentials are transmitted over the network in plain text, which is highly insecure.

`Inbound authentication:` The **`login()`** function compares the input credentials directly with the hard-coded credentials.

The Vulnerable code can be mitigated by:

* Store credentials in a `secure configuration file` or database with appropriate `access control`.
* Apply `strong one-way hash functions` with random salts to passwords before storing them.
* Use `secure protocols` such as HTTPS for transmitting sensitive information over the network.
* Implement a `secure authentication mechanism` that compares the hashed input password with the stored hash, rather than comparing plain-text passwords directly.

### Mitigated Code

```python
import requests
import hashlib

# Load credentials from a secure configuration file or database
with open("config.txt", "r") as f:
    username, password_hash, salt = f.read().split()

# Outbound communication to an external component
response = requests.get("https://example.com/api", auth=(username, password_hash))

# Inbound authentication using passwords
def login(user, pwd):
    # Apply strong one-way hash with salt to the incoming password
    pwd_hash = hashlib.sha256((pwd + salt).encode()).hexdigest()
    # Compare the hashed password with the stored hash
    if user == username and pwd_hash == password_hash:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

The Mitigated code does the following:

* It applies a `strong one-way hash` with a salt to the incoming password during authentication.
* The secure loading of credentials from a `configuration file or database`. It reads the username, password hash, and salt from the "config.txt" file, assuming they are stored securely.
