## About CWE ID 125

_<mark style="color:green;">**Out-of-Bounds Read**</mark>_

This Vulnerability occurs when a program reads data past the end or before the beginning of a buffer, which can result in reading unintended or sensitive information, or even cause the program to crash.

## Impact

* Privilege Escalation
* Data Corruption or Manipulation
* Denial of Service (DoS)

## Example with Code Explanation

## `C`

* Let us consider an example case and understand the CWE 125 with context of Vulnerable code and Mitigated code.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void vulnerable_function(char *input_string) {
    char buffer[10];
    strcpy(buffer, input_string); // potential out-of-bounds read vulnerability
    printf("%s\n", buffer);
}

int main() {
    char input[20] = "This is a test";
    vulnerable_function(input);
    return 0;
}
```

* The **`vulnerable_function`** function takes a string input and copies it to a buffer with a fixed size of 10 characters using the **`strcpy`** function. If the input string is longer than 10 characters, **`strcpy`** will write past the end of the **`buffer`**, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. The **`main`** function passes a string input of 20 characters to the **`vulnerable_function`**, which may cause it to read beyond the end of the buffer, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or security issues.
* Some of the ways the Vulnerable code can be mitigated is:
  * Ensure that the `input length` is `checked` before copying the input to the buffer to avoid writing beyond the end of the buffer.
  * Use safer string functions such as **`strncpy`** or **`snprintf`** that limit the number of characters copied and prevent buffer overflows.
  * Use compiler flags such as **`-fstack-protector`** to enable stack canaries, which can help detect buffer overflows at runtime.
  * Use a buffer size that is large enough to accommodate the maximum expected input size, or dynamically allocate memory to store the input.

### Mitigated Code

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#define MAX_INPUT_LENGTH 100

void safer_function(const char *input_string) {
    char *buffer = (char *) malloc(MAX_INPUT_LENGTH + 1); // dynamically allocate buffer
    if (buffer == NULL) {
        printf("Error: Could not allocate memory for buffer.\n");
        exit(1);
    }
    strncpy(buffer, input_string, MAX_INPUT_LENGTH); // use strncpy to limit the number of characters copied
    buffer[MAX_INPUT_LENGTH] = '\0'; // add null terminator to the end of the string
    printf("%s\n", buffer);
    free(buffer); // free dynamically allocated memory
}

int main() {
    safer_function("Hello, world!");
    return 0;
}
```

* The Mitigated code does the following:
  * The buffer size is dynamically allocated to a maximum length of **`MAX_INPUT_LENGTH`** characters, which can accommodate all expected inputs without overflowing the buffer.
  * The **`strncpy`** function is used to limit the number of characters copied to the buffer, preventing overflows and ensuring that the null terminator is included.
  * A `null terminator` is added to the end of the string to ensure that it is properly terminated, preventing out-of-bounds reads of uninitialized memory.
  * After the use of the buffer, the dynamically allocated memory is freed, `preventing memory leaks` and ensuring that the buffer is not used after it has been freed.

## `C++`

### Vulnerable Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>

void vulnerable_function(char *input_string) {
    char buffer[10];
    std::strcpy(buffer, input_string); // potential out-of-bounds read vulnerability
    std::cout << buffer << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    char input[20] = "This is a test";
    vulnerable_function(input);
    return 0;
}
```

* In this vulnerable code, the **`vulnerable_function`** function takes a string input and copies it to a buffer with a fixed size of 10 characters using the **`strcpy`** function. If the input string is longer than 10 characters, **`strcpy`** will write past the end of the **`buffer`**, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
* The **`main`** function passes a string input of 20 characters to the **`vulnerable_function`**, which may cause it to read beyond the end of the buffer, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or security issues.
* Some of the ways the Vulnerable code can be mitigated is:
  * Ensure that the `input length is checked` before copying the input to the buffer to avoid writing beyond the end of the buffer.
  * Use a buffer size that is large enough to accommodate the maximum expected input size, or dynamically allocate memory to store the input.
  * Use safer string functions such as **`strncpy`** or **`snprintf`** that limit the number of characters copied and prevent buffer overflows.
  * Use C++ standard library classes like **`std::string`** instead of C-style strings and character arrays, which have built-in boundary checking and can help prevent buffer overflows.

### Mitigated Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

void safe_function(const std::string& input_string) {
    const size_t MAX_INPUT_LENGTH = 10;
    char buffer[MAX_INPUT_LENGTH + 1] = {0}; // allocate memory for buffer and initialize it to 0
    const size_t copy_len = std::min(input_string.length(), MAX_INPUT_LENGTH); // ensure that we don't copy more than MAX_INPUT_LENGTH characters
    size_t result = snprintf(buffer, MAX_INPUT_LENGTH + 1, "%s", input_string.substr(0, copy_len).c_str()); // use snprintf to copy input_string into buffer and ensure null termination
    if (result > MAX_INPUT_LENGTH) {
        std::cerr << "Error: Input string too long!" << std::endl;
        return;
    }
    std::cout << buffer << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    std::string input = "This is a test";
    safe_function(input);
    return 0;
}
```

* The Mitigated code does the following:
  * The **`safe_function()`** function uses **`snprintf()`** to copy the input string into the buffer, which ensures that the copied string is null-terminated and will not write beyond the buffer's size.
  * The function checks if the return value of **`snprintf()`** is greater than **`MAX_INPUT_LENGTH`**. If it is, then it prints an error message and returns immediately, preventing any further code execution that might use the buffer.

## `Java`

### Vulnerable Code

```java
public class OutOfBoundsReadExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        int index = 5; // This index is out of bounds

        int result = numbers[index]; // Accessing an array element out of bounds

        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
```

* We have an array of integers called **`numbers`** that has five elements. We then attempt to access an element of the array using an index of **`5`**. Since the array only has five elements, the index of **`5`** is out of bounds, and attempting to access this element will result in an out-of-bounds read.
* Some of the ways the vulnerability can be remediated is:
  * Use defensive programming techniques, such as `input validation and error checking`, to catch out-of-bounds read errors before they occur.
  * Always ensure that `array indices` used to access array elements are within the bounds of the array.
  * Use Java's built-in bounds checking mechanism to help prevent out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities.

### Mitigated Code

```java
public class MitigatedOutOfBoundsReadExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        int index = 5;

        if (isValidIndex(index, numbers)) { // Check if the index is within bounds
            int result = numbers[index];
            System.out.println(result);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Index is out of bounds.");
        }
    }

    public static boolean isValidIndex(int index, int[] array) {
        return index >= 0 && index < array.length;
    }
}
```

* The Mitigated code does the following:
  * We've added a method called **`isValidIndex()`** that checks if the given index is within the bounds of the given array.
  * In the main method, we use this **`isValidIndex()`** method to check if the index is within bounds before attempting to access the corresponding array element.
  * If the index is `out of bounds`, we print an error message instead of attempting to access the array element.
