Welcome to SecuCODE, a unique repository that provides examples of vulnerable and mitigated code in multiple programming languages, categorized by CWE ID. This project aims to serve as an educational resource for individuals interested in learning from a source code perspective. 📚💻

## What is SecuCODE?

SecuCODE is a project dedicated to offering vulnerable and mitigated code snippets, classified according to Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) IDs. The repository serves as a valuable resource for those seeking to understand and improve their understanding of secure coding practices. 🛡️

## Why SecuCODE?

The motivation behind creating SecuCODE stems from the lack of a centralized repository that offers a comprehensive collection of vulnerable and mitigated code examples. Existing repositories often focus on specific CWE IDs, leaving many vulnerabilities unaddressed. We aim to bridge this gap by providing a wide array of CWE categories and fostering a learning community around source code review. 🚀

## How Can You Contribute?

SecuCODE thrives on community contributions. We welcome everyone to participate in this endeavor. If you spot a mistake or wish to make a correction, don't hesitate to raise a Pull Request (PR). Additionally, if you'd like to add a new CWE Class category, please feel free to do so by following the provided template. 🤝🌟:smiling_face_with_three_hearts:

## Who Can Benefit From SecuCODE?

SecuCODE is a valuable resource for anyone seeking to learn from vulnerable code and understand how vulnerabilities can be mitigated. This repository is especially beneficial for budding Appsec Engineers and developers, providing insights into the security perspective of code implementation. 👩‍💻👨‍💻

## Categorization and Future Plans

Currently, our primary focus is to complete the collection for the first CWE Top 25. Beyond that, we have plans to expand and cover other CWE categories, ensuring a comprehensive repository for a wide range of vulnerabilities. 🗂️📈

## How to Contribute?

We highly encourage you to contribute to our project by submitting Pull Requests through our GitHub profile: [SecuCODE GitHub](https://github.com/c0n5n3d/SecuCODE). Your contributions will help improve this resource and support the wider community in their journey to understanding secure coding practices. 💪🌎
